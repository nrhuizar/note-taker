# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is my first attempt at back-end development.  Using Node and Express (and given the front-end), I was able to build a note taking app that stores notes as objects in a JSON file.  The application is deployed on Heroku.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, you will need to install Node, Express, and FS to use this application.


## Usage

This project can be used to keep track of notes but the main use of this project was to begin building full-stack applications.  I was able to get it running and smooth, but had a bit of trouble deleting notes from the database.
